* bibliography-mode
An Emacs minor-mode for my /annotated bibliography/

*CREDITS* The idea of an annotated bibliography is not mine! See [[http://cachestocaches.com/2020/3/org-mode-annotated-bibliography/][Managing my Annotated Bibliography with Emacs' Org Mode]] by [[http://gjstein.com/][Gregory J Stein]]. Neither is the idea of using a minor-mode to accomplish this. This is a limited/modified version of [[https://github.com/rougier/org-bib-mode][org-bib-mode]] by [[https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/][Nicolas P. Rougier]]
* Introduction
** Pre-Requisites
=bibliography-mode= requires the following packages:
- [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]] (the previews are defined using the nano-faces)
- [[https://github.com/shg/org-inline-pdf.el][org-inline-pdf]] (optional, if you want a neat preview of the PDF)
** Installation
The starting point is the file =bibliography.el= which can obtained by
- Cloning this repository and placing =bibliography.el= in your Emacs load-path
- [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]
- [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa.el]]

Once you have =bibliography.el= include it in your configuration (=init.el=)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'bibliography)
#+end_src
Now set the path for your /annotated bibliography/ path (for instance, =papers.org=)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq bibliography-path "~/papers.org")
#+end_src
Finally, to allow =bibliography-mode= to search in your bibliography
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list org-agenda-files bibliography-path)
#+end_src
That's it! Open up your bibliography file and turn on the minor-mode =M-x bibliography-mode=
